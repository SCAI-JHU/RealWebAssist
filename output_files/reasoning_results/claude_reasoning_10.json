        "220": "Based on the webpage and the instruction \"Yes, core contact,\" I need to identify the correct element to click on. \n\nLooking at the current Expedia search results page showing hotel options, the most relevant element would be the \"Continue with your booking\" button. This blue button appears in the hotel listing and would allow you to proceed with booking the Hotel Beacon which you previously selected.\n\nThe correct element to click would be the \"Continue with your booking\" button in the blue section at the top of the hotel listing.",
        "221": "Based on the webpage and the instruction \"Okay, click on Accessibility,\" the correct element to click would be the \"Accessibility\" tab shown in the navigation menu at the bottom section of the page. \n\nIt appears as one of the main navigation tabs alongside \"Overview,\" \"About,\" \"Rooms,\" and \"Policies.\" The Accessibility tab is clearly visible in the horizontal menu below the hotel images. This would take you to the accessibility information for Hotel Beacon.",
        "222": "Based on the webpage and the instruction \"Look on. Go to overview,\" the correct element to click would be the \"Overview\" tab/link located in the navigation menu at the top of the page. \n\nI can see that the current page is displaying the Accessibility information for Hotel Beacon, and the user wants to navigate to the Overview section. The \"Overview\" tab appears as the first option in the horizontal navigation menu that also includes \"About,\" \"Rooms,\" \"Accessibility\" (which is currently active), and \"Policies.\"",

This is the button with the X icon in the circle near the top left of the currently open accessibility information dialog box. Clicking this X button will close the current modal and return you to the main hotel information page.\n\nAlternatively, you could also use the browser's back button (the left-pointing arrow) at the top left of the browser window, though the X button in the modal is more directly applicable to the current context.",
        "229": "Based on the webpage image and the instruction \"Oh, click on yes,\" I don't see any element that explicitly says \"yes\" on this Expedia hotel search page. The instruction might be referring to accepting something that was previously shown but is not visible in the current screenshot.\n\nThe main interactive elements I can see in the current view include:\n- The \"Continue with your booking\" button at the top\n- Heart/favorite icons next to hotel listings\n- \"Select your room\" button for Hotel Beacon\n- Hotel listing information and navigation arrows\n\nWithout seeing a dialog box or prompt that would require a \"yes\" response, I cannot identify the correct element to click for this instruction. The user may need to clarify what they're trying to approve or confirm on this page.",
        "231": "Based on the webpage and the history of instructions, the correct element to click to see all about this property would be the link labeled \"See all about this property\" with the right-pointing arrow (>) that appears in the lower section of the page. \n\nThis link is located below the amenity icons (showing Room service, Parking available, Free WiFi, Bar, Pet friendly, and Gym) and would provide more detailed information about the Andaz 5th Avenue, by Hyatt hotel.

The \"About\" tab in the main navigation menu (top of the page, next to \"Overview\")\n2. The \"About\" tab in the modal/popup that is currently open (at the top right of the popup, next to \"Amenities\")\n\nSince your most recent instruction was to click on \"About\" and the current state shows a popup with amenities information, the correct element to click would be the \"About\" tab in the popup, which is located at the top right of the dialog box, next to \"Amenities\".",
        "233": "Based on the image and the history provided, the correct element to click for the instruction \"Okay, go back to amenities\" would be the \"Amenities\" tab shown in the modal dialog box.
