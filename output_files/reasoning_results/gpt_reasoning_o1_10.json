Over time, additional House of Blues venues appeared in cities across the United States.\n\n2) Move from Cambridge to Boston  \n   \u2022 The Cambridge location closed in the late 1990s, and House of Blues later opened a new venue in Boston\u2019s Fenway neighborhood.  \n   \u2022 The current Boston venue, often just called \u201cHouse of Blues Boston,\u201d began operation in 2009 at 15 Lansdowne Street, right near Fenway Park.\n\n3) Name Change / Sponsorship to \u201cCitizens House of Blues Boston\u201d  \n   \u2022 In September 2022, House of Blues Boston announced a new sponsorship deal with Citizens (the banking corporation).  \n   \u2022 As part of that deal, the venue\u2019s official name became \u201cCitizens House of Blues Boston.\u201d Many people casually still refer to it simply as House of Blues Boston, but the new sponsored name appears in current promotional materials and on tickets.\n\nSo if you see \u201cCitizens House of Blues Boston,\u201d it\u2019s the same House of Blues near Fenway\u2014just newly sponsored.

That is the correct element to trigger the \u201cAbout\u201d view.",
        "233": "From the screenshot and the tab layout, the correct element to click is the tab labeled \u201cAmenities\u201d in that pop\u2010up (i.e. the \u201cAmenities\u201d tab button at the top of the dialog).",
        "234": "A quick way to tell is that Expedia includes a \u201cBack to search\u201d (or \u201cSee all properties\u2026\u201d) link at the top of the hotel\u2010details page. In other words, rather than one of the tabs or the browser Back button, the correct element to click is that dedicated \u201cBack to search results\u201d link Expedia places near the top left."
